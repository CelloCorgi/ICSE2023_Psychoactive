And I don't know if you've ever – you've probably heard of people taking those sorts of substances for public speaking. It kinda works the same way.

And it plagues even those of us who are quite experienced, unfortunately.

I find it hard to be motivated, I find it hard to focus, and it makes it makes it harder for me to enjoy... it affects my work-life balance and I have more trouble doing non-work activities as well, because the environment thickens to get associated with work in addition to leisure activities.

mentalHealth,workStressGood,,,"When they say work is stressful, but 'it is a good kind of stress' or they like the stress","I’d say it's a good stress. There's a lot of people who are really good at what they do. And so you're always seeing kind people post or release all this amazing stuff. So from that point of view, there's this feeling of like, “Oh, I need to also be making like, launching features or doing something that people are impressed by.” So I'd say the stress is more self-driven than it is from the top-down or anything like that.",
mentalHealth,workStressExpected,,,"It is stressfull, but as expected","It can be fairly stressful. I don't know if I would say undue because I understood what I'm signing up for. That there's companies that their entire business relies on.

mentalHealth,accommodations,,,Generally if someone is talking about accomodations: will likely be one of the sub-tags below:,,Inital Code
mentalHealth,,haveReceived,,When they are talking about accomidations that they have received,"Yes, more because of the PTSD. I forget things a lot, but also turns out that was the ADHD too.

They did say there were other options if I needed them, but when I started I was like, 'No, I don't really need them.",Pass 2
mentalHealth,,available,,Accomidations that are available but they have not used,"they have things like employee assistance programs that you can have things like, I think it's three or four free therapist visits that are covered under that phone, like telehealth services, that kind of stuff. Now, as far as mental health days, so to speak, I don't think they have anything that's specifically under that umbrella, but you could take a sick day if you need to, if you're not feeling up to par. There are certainly very reasonable around that type of stuff",
mentalHealth,,considering,,When they are talking about thinking about getting accomodations,"No, but that's because I haven't requested any. I think again, that's where remote work is very helpful because I think a lot of the things that my ADHD affects my working style. Where maybe I would have to explain myself if I was working in an office, I don't really have to do with remote work. So yeah, I think that's prevented the need for it. I actually was considering if I might have to look into accommodations just because my manager was requesting I go back to the office, but I don't think it'll be necessary for me. Like basically, I just gave my reasons for I just think it's better for me to be remote and I think he said it's fine and he'll talk to HR but like, if it does end up being a thing where I have to go back into the office, I am planning on looking into accommodations.",Pass 2
mentalHealth,,desires,,When talking about accomodations they would like in general,"So for example, when you do physical medical exam like every one year, six months, I would also recommend people with high stress software tasks or work, having longer work hours, to check them up every three months. It’s just a personal opinion, maybe three months or six months, whatever",Pass 2
mentalHealth,,process,,When talking about the process of getting accomidations,"So it kind of did, because – well, maybe not directly remote work but like, COVID things. Yeah. I mean, we did go remote for a couple months, March to June or so. And I think during that time, I learned a lot more about how I do and don't have an ability to focus. So when we went back to in-person, I realized I had a better handle of what kind of distractions were affecting me. So actually during that time, I went through the whole disability accommodation process and now I have my own private office in the building.",Pass 2
mentalHealth,,reception,,When talking about the reception by others for the accomidations they received,"So I think everybody is supportive. They're just sort of rigid and they're like, “We have to follow this process.” And then within my group, it has been a little bit mildly awkward trying to explain [my accomidation] to neurotypical people like why this makes sense. But nobody has argued about it or been weird about it.",Pass 2
mentalHealth,stigma,,,When talking about observing stigma about mental health in software environments,"Not very openly. Like I have never that I can recall experienced, like in a group setting or a meeting, someone bringing it up. In person, just on one-on-one conversations or when there's a small group of coworkers, sometimes we'll bring it up like talk about feeling a little bit burnt out. But still I do feel like there's some sort of stigma around it as well. Like it's not something that people are openly discussing. Like it's kind of in hushed.",
mentalHealth,support,,,When devlopers talk about recieving support from coworkers and managers for mental health,"I was just going to say my boss, you know, never really talked about mental health, but he was always very generous and compassionate with regards to giving employees, you know, employees a break from stress or, you know, he never put pressure on us, never.",

mentalHealth,relianceOnSubstance,,,How much they rely on substances to work (mention if prescribed),"Like if you asked me to just go completely sober, no caffeine, no Adderall, nothing, I'm certainly going to have a come down and some sort of hangover and withdrawal effect from years of caffeine use and now months of Adderall usage. Just cutting that cold turkey. It's not going to be painful per se, but I'm certainly not going to get anything close to what I'm used to done because it's just very hard for me to focus. And as I said, the executive dysfunction issues.",Inital Code
mentalHealth,physicalHealth,,,How physical health is impacted at work or use of mind-altering substances to help with physical health during work,"I do get a little bit of wrist pain, at least I did for the first few months, but then one I got a pair of compression gloves, and I also got a padded a wrist rest for my keyboard. That helped improve the kind of angle at which my hands were using the keyboard.",Inital Code
mentalHealth,improvements,,,How the company could improve how they talk about mental health/substance use and or things they could do to reduce stress,"I mean, really simple things, right? Like you could give more vacation, like you, or you can have a more days off. Americans just don't get enough time off, and that's really bad. They could give you like, you know, more resources and not create so many roadblocks. I think fundamentally, it comes down to like if someone is like very stressed, I think that bad mental health is just going to be downstream of that. You can't say that someone has depression if five of their family members just died, like that's a natural response. They don't have the condition to be treated. Their symptoms might be worse and they might benefit from SSRIs, but I wouldn't say that they have depression, I think that they're a normal human being",Inital Code

I was both working as a [TA] in a class at [redacted]. as well as taking graduate courses to complete my masters.

In addition to what one psychiatrist described to me as just underlying neurochemistry where I'm just naturally more anxious. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder that was being exacerbated by my environment. And so in the beginning of 2021, January, I was prescribed, Serotonin agents like Zoloft.",Pass 2
mentalHealth,symptomsAtWork,,,When sought diagnosis due to (in part) noticing symptoms at work - this does not include ADHD (see below),"So yeah, I mean, so the SSRIs, I just use 24/7.

Yeah, I think that's true of SSRIs and also Wellbutrin.",Pass 2
mentalHealth,,diagnosis,,Sought diagnosis because of their noticing symptoms at work,"I think it helped me a lot because I could not focus for – initially I was went through a major event that time. I had a hard time for focusing on the office for a month. So I took, mostly took like 20 days leave out of one month, something like that. So that's like you have like 22 work days days a month later. So if you take 22 days, it’s almost a whole month’s leave. So after that I consulted a psychiatrist and neurologist, they prefer offer me this medicine and after I started taking this medicine I could gradually shift to my daily to-do work.",
mentalHealth,medicationSwitching,,,When talking about how a medication switching impacted software work,"I would say. Well, when I went down from 50 to 25, there were a couple of days there were I just could not get up.

mentalHealth,performativity,,,When mental health talk from a company or co-worker feels performative,"And so I think that's the issue these days, because everybody has mental health problems kind of tells you that it's because they have shitty jobs and shitty lives and they're not really getting time off or good health care and all of this other stuff. So yeah, doing a webinar and like, you know, virtue signaling about how they want to celebrate and mental health awareness month is really stupid in my opinion.",Pass 2
mentalHealth,reasonForLeaving,,,When mental health or the lack of mental health resources contributes to someone leaving a software job,"After I graduated from undergrad, I worked for one year and three months at a start-up in [Redacted]. I left because of depression, and I've sort of been dealing with recurrent mental health issues over since then.",Pass 2
ADHD,diagnosisProcess,,,When talking about how a mental health diagnosis process impacted software work,"So I saw psychiatrist for that. He said no it's just a major depressive disorder. And I was like, okay, so he put me on Wellbutrin. That helped me really get into coding. I remember I started it like the last week of my coding bootcamp. And that one is also... helps with ADHD. So it helps with focusing. You can take it for ADHD, you can also take it for depression. So I took a Wellbutrin and Lexapro combo, was able to finish my final project for my coding bootcamp. The week before I was like sleeping all week, started taking it that week. My project was due Saturday. I decided Friday to change my project idea like the day before it was due. So I coded my whole app in under 24 hours. Little did I know that that was actually mania induced from the Wellbutrin",Pass 2

ADHD,sideEffects,,,Side effects of ADHD medications: Interesting to see the love/hate relationship some people have toward prescription stimulants.,"Well, yes. With Ritalin and Adderall. I used these only two or three times, and it would always be the same. I took the lowest dose possible. My jaws would clench. I would get excessively anxious and that angst in my chest, as though something wrong was going to happen. And then, I just well, I cannot do it today. I had to do not work this day.",Pass 2
ADHD,agile,,,Impacts on agile or scrum or flexible work structures for those who have ADHD,"And it works out well because we got some people who are absolutely morning owls and we've got people in other time zones. So there's always someone around the clock who's able to respond with this problem. So like I said, I don't enjoy the evening interruptions, but occasionally if some high priority thing comes up in the evening, my teammates know that I've usually got it, unless it gets too late and then it goes to one of our teams overseas. And then in the mornings, I know that if my phone rings, or a buzz at 10 AM or at 9AM or something, I'm fully awake and present and 100 percent ready to go. I just have to make sure that one of the teammates has seen it and he'll take it from there",Pass 2
ADHD,feelingsOnStimUsage,,,"People with ADHD commenting on others' usage of ADHD meds or others using it for enhancement, etc. For example, people mentioning that it 'doesn't give you superpowers","I suppose they could change if people understood that you are taking Adderall to help you focus. A) it's not cheating. I don't view anything, there's not like, this sort of concept is you're getting an unfair advantage I suppose some people have – I think it's dumb. So if they didn't have that perception, I suppose that would be an improvement. And noting that it's like somehow dangerous, like taking recreational methamphetamines because that would also be good if they didn't have that perception either.",Pass 2
ADHD,symptomsAtWork,,,Impacts of ADHD on work,"I tried skipping my Ritalin on a work day, unfortunately, my performance plummeted. So yeah, so I always take Ritalin. [inaudible] I won't be able to do my job without it.",
ADHD,,diagnosis,,Sought diagnosis because of their noticing symptoms at work," So I am to my knowledge, undiagnosed ADHD. But I had went to see my primary care physician a few months ago with the sole purpose that I was having trouble focusing at work.",
socialImpacts,selfDisclosure,,,"If they disclose their substance use at work, and how",N/A - will be one of the sub codes below,Inital Code
socialImpacts,,yes,,If they have told someone,"I've been pretty open. There was a point in my life where I was very against using medications. As Tiktok says, I don't want to dull my sparkle... the sparkle is like me with a dirty apartment. So there was always that. And I got to a point where I was like, I'm not keeping this a secret anymore. This is something I struggle with. And if someone wants to ask about finding a psychiatrist or a mental health professional, I want to be that person for other people. So I haven't kept it a secret. I'm pretty open about it if anyone asks.",
socialImpacts,,no,,If they have not told someone,"Well, I definitely won't mention the cannabis at work or drinking during work hours. So I guess so.",
socialImpacts,otherDisclosure,,,"If others at work diclose to them their substance use, and how","I had a colleague who was a close friend who had come to work once and he said he smoked this morning before he came in and that he was – hm, it wasn’t a memorable event.",Inital Code
socialImpacts,rumorDisclosure,,,Rumors they have heard about others using substances at work,"this is second-hand information on my part, but I've heard of people who while working from home are usually stoned while working because it helps them relax and focus. I don't directly know anyone who uses cannabis while working, but it's unsurprising to me that there are people in the company who do that, and if it works for them, then cool.",
socialImpacts,stigma,,,General thoughts on stigma regarding substance use at work,"I just wish everyone was more open about it and it was less stigmatized. I feel like there are probably so many people in my company that are just like me where they do it in secret. Organizationally, it's not a problem and no one's going to get fired over it. Yeah, I just wish everyone was just more open about it.",Inital Code
socialImpacts,,yes,,If they personally feel stigma from substance use at work,"One instance I remember someone like rolling their eyes when another person mentioned that they had to take a mental health day, or that they were going to start antidepressants or things like that. It was like 'Ugh, get over yourself,' like that type of attitude.",Pass 2
socialImpacts,,no,,If they do not personally feel stigma from substance use at work,"I've never really experienced particularly strong, you know, anti drug stigma in my life. I mean, it seems like in my social circles.. I don't know it's almost, almost like perhaps an overly optimistic pro-drug bias. In the sense of being overly optimistic with regards to the efficacy of, of, of certain psychoactive drugs. To which I am skeptical the efficacy in certain situations. But I don't know. I could certainly be wrong",Pass 2
socialImpacts,outcomes,,,Actual or hypothetical effects from selfDisclosure own psychoactive substance use with coworkers/boss - use one of the sub-tages below to distinguish,N/A - will be one of the sub codes below,
socialImpacts,,positive,hypothetical,,N/A - no quotes,Pass 2
socialImpacts,,negative,hypothetical,,"I would say overall like, not – the fact that I'm not openly sharing that, “Hey, I might...smoke a lot of weed.” It probably is for the reputational repercussions. I'd say probably for that one, mostly",Pass 2
socialImpacts,,positive,actual,,"I think it helped me feel more comfortable with my manager. It helped me... I appreciated that my manager was understanding and supportive. And in that nature, it made me a better communicator with them because I felt... even if I wanted to just say, 'Hey, this thing I'm working on is too hard for me and I need help,' or something like that. I felt a lot more comfortable saying that, rather than struggling silently. So it definitely did boost communication between me and my manager because I understood that he was empathetic and understanding of that",Pass 2
socialImpacts,,negative,actual,,"Yes, I think when I talked about openly about that, I had trouble from management because it had an impact on my yearly performance review and compensation review. I think that that had a significant effect on the after the first year when I started sharing thing because it was not taking normal because the culture that was, the more you work, the more you – I mean, you have to prove yourself like that, you're able to take much more stress or something like that. You don't show yourself you are weak in some aspects of your performance like that.",Pass 2
socialImpacts,wfh,,,Talking about the social impacts from work from home,"I think any sort of social, friendly interactions happen regardless of whether they're coming into the office. So I wouldn't say me coming into the office more often has any bearing or impact on how friendly I am with my coworkers.",Pass 2
socialImpacts,socializingEffects,,,"Effects or indirect effects of substance use on socializing with coworkers (whether it's from the knowledge that others use substances, the direct effects of a substance, etc.)","So not specifically, I’d say in terms of having happy hour with people or if someone's like, “Oh hey, I smoke weed,” it's legal in [Redacted], right? It's like “oh, this person trusts me, they feel comfortable sharing this.” So in that way, I'd say you can connect with someone over something like that. Just because you know you both trust each other to share things",Inital Code
socialImpacts,,friends,,When socializing effecs of substances leads to becoming friends with coworkers,"And then as far as my own interactions with them, of course, it changed a little bit because I developed closer friendships with those people. So kind of just became... I guess more candid in the way we spoke to each other and not quite that like business way that people can talk at work, if that makes sense",
socialImpacts,,usedTogether,,When talks about using a substance with coworkers in a social (nonwork) setting,"My team is pretty open about it. I have smoked with a few of my coworkers. And it’s talked about, but never really in the sense that, “oh, I was working on this task and I was high.” It’s more ethereal, in a sense [Clarified that was social setting in transcript]",
socialImpacts,cultureClash,,,Clash of cultures between interviewee and other people at work for non-generational related reasons,"Because it's a distraction and other people might not understand it the same way as different cultures. Like in my culture, people understand that. In that company's culture, it's totally foreign to them and they'd be like, 'Oh, like what are you getting high while working? Or they might think that it's a liability, or like if I'm doing something wrong, but I'm actually much more likely to sit there and focus on the whole task and not get up several times. They they definitely are unfamiliar with it, it's foreign to them and they would have taken it the wrong way.",Pass 2
socialImpacts,,generations,,When the culture clash seems to be caused by generatinal differences,"Yes. That and just the senior developer when I was talking about just older developers not being understanding of those things. He was older. He has been in the game for a very long time. And so he was one of the main reasons I left, because I was not getting support from him as this was my first role outside of boot camp. I went in to learn everything and take everything in and I couldn't because I didn't have that support.",
socialImpacts,,country,,When the culture clash seems to be caused by country differences,"Yeah. I think it's maybe, that's probably it. It's been legal so long and I'm European, so I have a completely different view than a lot of... I think my American friends when it comes to having a glass of wine with lunch or something. Like the last company I worked for was a [Redacted] company. And whenever I go to [Redacted] they would have their work cafeteria had wine and it was just assumed that it's okay to drink. But yeah, I think that's the reason",
socialImpacts,,drugs,,When the culture clash is about substances,"So if somebody was like 'Yeah. I don't drink coffee, like ever. I've never had a sip of caffeine in my life.' You might look at them a different way. I think it would be like that. Like oh, like 'Who is this person? Like do they think they're better than me for not taking that or not drinking that?'. I think, I think it would be a very similar situation. Tension, but like the reverse way, or something like that",
socialImpacts,solidarity,,,Sharing substance use or mental health issues with others based on a shared usage or suffering!,"Yeah, like if someone told me 'Oh yeah, I take Adderall for ADHD or whatever.' Like yeah, I'd probably say 'Yeah, I do too.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,sharingSubstances,,,When talking about sharing or using substances with coworkers at work,"Yes. So before I would occasionally borrow a stimulant here and there, I will do modafinil, which I just got myself nearly every morning. And then caffeine quite a bit more than I use today.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,keepItToYourself,,,"For mentions of hypothetical or real people keeping drug usage to themselves so employers don't have to know or take action on it, or have a policy on substances","I have some clients that I know are open to it. However, because they have government back [inaudible]. They'd rather not know about it. Not that they even shun it at all, but because of the liability, because of the contract they hold. They don't really want that association if it's public facing. I keep it to myself for the sake of my clients, as well.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,mediaMention,,,"Mentioning popular culture (like Twitter, TikTok, the Ballmer Peak, Limitless, etc.). ","It's maybe been once or twice, someone has like... people I know that don't drink or don't use anything that have kind of made a negative comment, but not about different coworkers, but just overall like, I don't know... [Redacted] made a comment about the Johnny Depp court case, whatever it is, the legal thing. Then something about like, 'Oh, they're just probably doing so many drugs that their brains are fried,' or something like that, but nothing nothing other than that.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,opinion,,,Their opinions on psychoactive substance use in software environments,"Because some of these substances are not necessarily impairing. Sometimes a little bit of a downer can help you to calm down and get in the work. But not necessarily concentrate, but if you're at a point where like you're like drowsy and falling asleep, that's not helpful either. So I think the point is impairment regarding substances.",Inital Code
softwareWorkCulture,drugPolicy,,,Experience with drug tests in software environments or drug policies given or not given by companies,"I don't think so. I think they want, like I know they want you to be truthful. But again, like that's so much ambiguity. I feel like I'm being truthful, but it's like 'Okay, If you asked me 'Have you used federally illegal substances, then I would have.",Inital Code
softwareWorkCulture,,notStated,,When the drug policy is not stated by the company (or they don't think it is),"So, I did a quick search on our [redacted] page for just drug, and there's no like yeah, there's no mention of it in the employee handbook.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,,drugTests,,Their anecdotal experience about themselves or others drug testing for software jobs,"Initial screenings, yeah. I think every software job I've had, I've had to do the initial process, sudden panel or whatever it is.",
softwareWorkCulture,,impactChoiceToWork,,Participants talaking about if a company drug policy would impact their decision to work for a company,N/A - split into the three subcodes below,Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,,,yes,When participants say it would impact their decision,"Yes, it would if it were a restrictive policy.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,no,When participants say it would not impact their decision,"So a lot of drug policies, there's an initial screening and I don't mind those. I can – I don't mind quitting for a month, marijuana usage or whatever – Adderall usage for a few days to pass a drug screening like that. That wouldn't impact my decision if the company was promising and somewhere I wanted to work.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,maybe,When participants say it might impact their decision,"Possibly. Honestly, I don't if I see it in a listing, I don't even take it seriously. If they like really come at me about it, then I might be like, 'I'm not going to work for me if you guys are actually sticklers about it,' but I understand that they need to have it in their policy for insurance purposes.",
softwareWorkCulture,,complies,,"Some find drug testing necessary to inform employers on whether an employee is 'higher risk' or more liable to get in trouble with the law. Or, as long as they don't get in trouble, some software devs/software-related workers are okay with stopping their substance use for long enough to pass a drug test.","I mean, not really I would find it annoying, but I don't really have anything illegal in my system. So it wouldn't be big deal, I guess. I guess I would find it disrespectful to me personally, but it's not like a deal-breaker.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,,likes,,When someone likes the current drug policy at their company,"I think they are, yeah. I've not had any issues with them personally nor heard about people who are impacted negatively by the policies in a way that I thought was unfair.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,,dislikes,,When someone dislikes the current drug policy at their company,"No, they're not reasonable because I already did daily. Monthly, it's understandable. It's reasonable to do it monthly. But daily, weekly? Nah. They should give us a break",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,,trust,,When interviewees relate drug policies to employee trust,"And no, I really would not be comfortable working somewhere where they were going to, first of all, have that little trust in me. And like basically treat it as though you're guilty and have to prove your innocence. So that's like a huge deal breaker to me. But also, yeah, even the fact that I would be restricted from using substances that do make me feel better. Yeha, I mean, I've dealt with a lot in my life and anything that can bring me some relief, especially given how cannabis is really just not a problem. It's just not. And so yeah, I would not work somewhere if they drug tested. I don't think I would.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,,legality,,When interviewees relate drug policies to country legality,"No. I think they really need to... like, I'm in [Redacted] and cannabis, recreational marijuana, is legal here. I wish they would... I know they go by whatever the federal government says, but I don't think... I have a feeling that even if the government said it was okay, they would still have some sort of a policy.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,,ineffective,,When they think a drug policy doesn't work or would be ignored,"But if they like, actively stand up against it, like that might make me decide not to. But honestly like is the company in Nottingham going to come piss test me in the US? No. Totally ineffective.",
softwareWorkCulture,drugCulture,,,How coworkers or software culture in general acts/thinks about substance use,"I would say the startup actually had a much heavier drinking culture. It was not like, peer-pressured, or anything like that. But there were a lot of people who drank a lot, like quite frequently. And at a lot of team events people would definitely get really drunk. [short laugh] I'd say that's the main difference.",
softwareWorkCulture,,changes,,What they would like to change about drug Culutre in software,"I just wish everyone was more open about it and it was less stigmatized. I feel like there are probably so many people in my company that are just like me where they do it in secret. Organizationally, it's not a problem and no one's going to get fired over it. Yeah, I just wish everyone was just more open about it.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,be more open,When they would like software drug culture to be more open,"I think there could be more conversation about it. Like the substance abuse stuff is... with the cleared industry, it's like... they just assume that no one, you know, everyone's like a boy scout or girl scout or whatever and no one touches anything and it's just not discussed.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,decrease stigma,When they would like software drug culture to decrease stigma around drug use in software,"But it would be nice if people will start thinking that smoking marijuana, this also would be normal, could be considered normal. Because doing coding under the influence of cannabis versus alcohol influence, I would choose cannabis influence because it's not so severe in my opinion. And yeah, it's kind of easier to live with that.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,don't know / no change,When they don't know how they want software drug culture to change or don't want it to change,"I really don't know what I'd change, but... Let me think... To be honest, I really don't know if there is anything I'd change because basically these things are self driven, choices that people choose to make. So yeah, I don't know if there's anything I'd change about the drug use in software.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,increase education,When they would like software drug culture to increase education on how drugs can impact software,"I think maybe just more awareness and just people to talk more openly about it and also understand why some people might have a need to do that. Because I feel like – just my impression right now is that people either don't know that it happens or why people might do that. Or if they do, it’s seen very negatively – or not very negatively, but it's not, you know, like because there is a lack of information and understanding about why it might be helpful for some people to take these substances to do work, especially of a programming nature.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,less strict,When they would like software drug culture to include less strict drug policies,"Less strict drug tests from corporate companies, or yeah.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,make consistant,When they would like software drug culture to encourage drug policies to be more consistant,"I think if anything, it might be a line in the employee handbook that's just never been updated, but it feels weird that there is 4:30 written in the handbook.[...Redacted...] There's just that tiny bit of like it could be used against me. You know. It's a lingering thought. I mean, the current leadership is great and I don't think that that would be the case. But heaven forbid that there is a moment where I, you know, a group of us try to grab a beer from the fridge at four o'clock or 4:29, and they use that as opportunity for reprimand. Yeah. Past trauma. It's not related to current leadership, but yeah, the past.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,make more accesible / use more often,When they would like software drug culture to make substances in software more accesible and used more often in companies,"I would definitely like to see more co-working environments where people can smoke week freely or like sit down and take their adderall unbothered. It's funny because that's like a collaboration versus like sitting and getting in your zone.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,medical usage acceptance,When they would like software drug culture to accept medical substance use more,"Okay, so, I would normalize if someone have trouble focusing on themselves because I feel myself, that software engineering or debugging process is itself a mind-intensive task. And so some people might need help with who cannot take much more stress. I think it should be normalized. If someone takes stress or antidepressants.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,more explicit,When they would like software drug culture to make drug policies more explicit,"And I think given my experience working with situations where safety is at stake, I do think there should be – probably this would be most appropriate during safety trainings that you just explore and discuss together like what effect you might have. Like,we have [redacted] training courses we have to go through in order to be allowed to use [redacted], and I think it would be appropriate during that to just discuss if you're using something that slows down your reaction time, or reduces your ability to assess risk, then that would not be responsible.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,not software specific,When their answer on what they want to change is not software specific,"And then the second thing is, I truly fundamentally believe that psychedelics should be easy... should be freely available. And just, yeah, everyone should have access to it. Like there's a lot of drugs that are easy easy to get",
softwareWorkCulture,,,only care about performance impacts,"When they would like software drug culture to have people not care about what substances you use, but only care about performance","I think it would be trusting people to know what's best for them. Like, I think having expectations of how people behave at work is very important. And I think there are a lot of people who behave inappropriately at work even if they're sober. And there are people who work better on substances. So I think policies should focus on behavior and not what substances you do or don't use. I think there should be workplace protections for people who need to try different mental health medications. Honestly, I think it should be in laws. And you could technically make an argument for it under ADA, but it's not very directly stated. And I think it should be because a lot of people need to try different mental health meds and there’s not a very systematic way to do it right now. So, yeah, I think companies or universities should have an explicit policy of how supervisors should navigate that and what kind of expectations are appropriate or not appropriate when an employee is going through that process.",
softwareWorkCulture,,,productivity culture changes,When they would like software drug culture to not buy into software productivity culture as much,"I guess this is maybe more driven from working in [Redacted], people are focused – One, everyone's basically on the spectrum, or like autistic. And how much of it is like 'yo, detach from'... Like you have emotions, you should be able to experience them. You can note conflating your self-worth with your engineering, your stack rank, or I make this much money, or these are my equity options. Like to me, it's a slippery slope of... I don't know, fuck what is it. [...Redacted...] But to a certain degree, in certain things of how much are people trying to take a step back and realizing, or at least for, you know, dopaminergic agents of I'm doing this so I can work more, so I can have more output, so I can level up more. Because I have tiny penis syndrome, and I'm only measuring myself through my work output and not valuing myself as a human on other facets of my life.",
softwareWorkCulture,,location,, When the culture is specific to a certain country or region,"So the country I used to live in, alcohol is banned there. So you might take cigarettes, but there has to be outside the office, or you have a specific smoking zone, but you cannot take alcohol, beer, or other – I mean, alcoholic beverages or substances we – in work, I mean, you cannot take or come to work. So there was prohibition for that.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,,legality,,How legality of a substance in a specific location impacts culture in software environments,"Like I wouldn't talk about LSD use because it's still, I mean it's decriminalized but it's still illegal. So for that, definitely I would not mention it, but yeah, no I don't really fear it, it just doesn't come up. And so I don't really care to bring it up.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,corporateUse,,,When interviwees state or imply that software companies either do or should encourage use of a substance by its employees,"And then there's been other times where not just myself, but actually a group of software engineers that I work with will take hallucinogens and then talk through problems and interesting concepts in programming, which has been really quite cool. It's something that I'd like to see if we can somehow pursue into the future. You know, obviously there's some legal problems around that at this point in time, but I'm hoping as things progress it could be something that's actually more commonly done on like a team level.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,,happyHour,,When this substance is specifically alcohol,,Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,workLifeBalance,,,When talking about work life balance at software jobs,"Yeah. And because it's so small, and I only have one desk for me to both work and do my hobbies, so the ability for me to go into the office is really helpful for me to keep a work-life balance.",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,implicitMessaging ,,,"Formerally called PowerDynamics + Vibes - When Management or higher ups will allude or imply something isn't okay instead of just saying it's not permissible, which causes fear that taking a substance will hurt them in their job. This is sort of about peer pressure, too. Sometimes it's a part of the job culture to take certain substances on the job and new employees aren't going to be briefed on something like that.","I think they mostly are. If I'm being completely honest, I realize that I'm throwing stones from a glass house, getting my ADHD meds from a telehealth pill mill who spent seven minutes diagnosing me, But the rumors about how easy it is to get an ADHD prescription and then also the implicit acknowledgment and waiving the copay, if you fill it up [inaudible], the company pharmacy... it sends an interesting message. So I think overall the policy is good. I do think that waiving copay and being free with ADHD scripts is a little concerning, but I'm also throwing stones from a glass house here",Pass 2
softwareWorkCulture,howWouldManage,,,How would manage a developer using substances,"I mean, unless they directly told me that there were issues that they were having, I would just treat them like any other person I was managing.",
softwareWorkCulture,salary,,,When participants mention salery in any form,"Money is number one. With the inflation I make less than I did when I started. With very little annual raises. That's number one. Number two, I'm not super excited about my next... or this current project or the next one I'm pinned for. So that would actually probably be the biggest reason, just to do something that was more I don't know. I do [Redacted] contracts right now. Like I don't want to support [Redacted] anymore. Just a different type of work that I'm looking for.",
softwareWorkImpacts,productivity,,,When substance use impacts software work productivity in general (not strictly pos or neg),"But I think my overall productivity actually kind of stayed the same. But I was just as productive in a less healthy way because I would end up procrastinating or using these substances and not getting work done. And then I'd be like, “Oh, I really need to get this done.” So I was able to still be productive, but not in the most ideal way, I guess.",
softwareWorkImpacts,,increase,,When substance use impacts enjoyment of software productivity in a positive way,"Oh, it's been almost life-changing. It’s been wonderful. I'm way more focused obviously, but I'm also way more productive. It's a lot. Even when there's distractions at hand, I am able to manage those distractions better. I'm able to focus on my tasks better. I'm able to complete things in a faster time-frame than I could before. And it makes me almost want to start working each day.",
softwareWorkImpacts,,decrease,,When substance use impacts enjoyment of software productivity in a negative way,"So that's actually a really interesting question because I want to say I was less productive because especially for weed or cannabis, I would say I don't think it's a productivity enhancer for programming.",
softwareWorkImpacts,enjoyment,,,When a substance impacts (or doesn't impact) enjoyment of software work in general (not strictly pos or neg),"So I would say it's definitely smoother sailing, but I can't tell more enjoyable.",
softwareWorkImpacts,,increase,,When substance use impacts enjoyment of software work in a positive way,"Not necessarily to the quality of work, not saying that it even makes like lesser quality but just like that could be my Saturday night plan is like, 'No one's going to bother me. I'm going to tune in and get this work done' and that is a high for me.",
softwareWorkImpacts,,decrease,,When substance use impacts enjoyment of software work in a negative way,"Not so much so with the psychedelic ones because personally for me they don't make it necessarily more pleasant. They, they make me more creative and outward. But there is an internal discomfort and agitation that happens even in my case, even when microdosing.",
softwareWorkImpacts,creativity,,,When substance use impacts software work creativity in general (not strictly pos or neg),"But I haven't experienced any improvement in my way of thinking in a way that I could probably solve something which is more complicated than I would usually do, but I felt more motivated to fix it.",
softwareWorkImpacts,,increase,,When substance use impacts software work creativity in a positive way,"I would say brainstorming for sure because marijuana changes your perspective more than other drugs. To me, when I compare Adderall versus marijuana, Adderall very much makes me focus, but it doesn't necessarily change the way I think as much as marijuana does. Marijuana doesn't make me focus as much, but definitely makes me think differently",
softwareWorkImpacts,,decrease,,When substance use impacts software work creativity in a negative way,"Brainstorming, I would usually not take medication on. The part that in this that might be more – you might find some interest in this of how much of the absence of an unmedicated ADHD rattled brain is... the subjectivity or the objectivity that you're brainstorming better or not, medicated or not. I think in my case, the unmedicated perspective is allowing more thoughts to freely form in very random manners. So I guess I'm more reviewing that through... I think the way I best view it is which tasks on here work probably better with linear thinking versus non-linear thinking. Non-linear, I would put in the camp of not gonna to medicate for. So I'd put in that, you know, brainstorming, maybe integration? But I don't really do too much of that. And maybe some system design?",
softwareWorkImpacts,focus,,,When substance use impacts software work focus in general (not strictly pos or neg),"Mmmhm. Focus, That's actually, why I bought these, these noise canceling headphones, in the first place, but that didn't help. I mean it did, but like not really.",
softwareWorkImpacts,,increase,,When substance use impacts software work focus in a positive way,"I think it helped a lot. It allowed me to let myself focus more on whatever task I had at hand, and not worry about any other things until I decided to[inaudible]. Basically be... the way that I felt how the SSRI effected is that it allowed me to be more in control of intrusive thoughts that made me anxious. And so I think that benefit was mainly like really helpful when I was working from home",
softwareWorkImpacts,,decrease,,When substance use impacts software work focus in a negative way,"Whereas marijuana, it was like, you know, I might – since I work from home, it's easy to like, you know, go down and make a coffee and, you know, let the dog out and do a couple little distracting things in the morning.",
softwareWorkImpacts,softSkills,,,If it impacts social software skills like communication or meetings in general (not strictly pos or neg),"I don't know, honestly. I think I'm definitely a little bit more rambly at standup meetings now that I'm not on Zoloft anymore, but not so much that it negatively impacts my ability to talk about the work I'm doing and my progress. But I definitely have noticed that I tend to add probably more detail into my conversations when I'm not on the SSRI because I kind of lose focus of the point of the conversation being just a high-level overview of what I'm working on.",
softwareWorkImpacts,,increase,,When substance use impacts software soft skills in a positive way,"Well, you know, when when you're sitting in front of the computer and you need to do something like writing an email or talk to somebody about some urgent topic, it's easier for me to smoke and do it than do it sober because I don't really like it. Maybe, yeah, that's the connection.",
softwareWorkImpacts,,decrease,,When substance use impacts software soft skills in a negative way,"I find it's easier to pay attention in meetings without Adderall because it's usually different people talking, you're kind of covering different subjects. So for my ADHD brain, it's easy to jump between these things without having worries about focusing because it's not as much focus as it is when coding. So that's definitely why it's much more useful for me when I'm focusing on the code than in social situations.",
softwareWorkImpacts,workQuality,,,When substance use impacts software work quality in general (not strictly pos or neg),"Not necessarily to the quality of work, not saying that it even makes like lesser quality but just like that could be my Saturday night plan is like, 'No one's going to bother me. I'm going to tune in and get this work done' and that is a high for me.",
softwareWorkImpacts,,increase,,When substance use impacts software work quality in a positive way,"I mean, if you asked me six, exactly six years ago and before I'd say it was just a coping mechanism and addiction to compensate for other stuff in life. But I've managed to work on that. And I'd say that, yeah, this is just for my productivity and to increase the quality of my perception and the outcome of my work.",
softwareWorkImpacts,,decrease,,When substance use impacts software work quality in a negative way,"Yeah, like if you drink a lot of alcohol when you're writing, something you might think, 'Oh, this is great,' but like when you actually go and edit it, it's like, 'Okay, this sucks here.",
softwareWorkImpacts,completeImpairment,,,When talking about substances impacting developers so much they cannot function,"But honestly the drowsiness of even being able to code. I think that's just going to make me have to work again or like someone's going to have to debug it or I can't even see the screen. So if I'm like physically impaired and can't even see what I'm typing, that's not going to work.",
softwareWorkImpacts,jobTypeImpacts,,,"When the substance use impacts different types of software jobs differenlty (e.g., safetly conscerns if working with lasers or other sensitive software)","Once again, broad depending on the application and the culture or the application and the substance. I mean, if I'm programming say something for weaponry. There's liability associated with that. If it's more of just like if I'm programming like an Uber... like a liability and risk to like human life, yes. Say I was programming a map to like send a delivery person somewhere. Like that's like really inconsequential.",
softwareWorkImpacts,leavingJob,,,When the substance use impacts (physical or cultural)causes someone to leave a job (in whole or in part),"Very small part, but yes, they are a reason. Just because I kinda feel like my interactions with my coworkers when it's that water cooler talk, it can be very dry sometimes, pun intended. So I feel like I would thrive in an environment where people were a little bit more relaxed about a lot of things.",
softwareWorkImpacts,debugging,,,How the substance use impacts debugging or testing (including quality assurance),"So then debugging. I mean, if someone's too cranked up and running through stuff, they're overlooking stuff. Like you definitely got to sit and look and watch their reaction. But if you're like elevated, I mean I'm using different slangs terms, but if these are different headspaces that people get in for that.",
softwareWorkImpacts,brainstorming,,,How the substance use impacts brainstorming,"I would say brainstorming for sure because marijuana changes your perspective more than other drugs. To me, when I compare Adderall versus marijuana, Adderall very much makes me focus, but it doesn't necessarily change the way I think as much as marijuana does. Marijuana doesn't make me focus as much, but definitely makes me think differently.",
softwareWorkImpacts,documentation,,,How the substance use impacts documentation,"I would say pretty significant. Again, if I'm working on a project that I'm really interested in and then I smoke, I'm so much more interested. I care a lot more about code quality and documentation. Suddenly I'm much, much more interested in it.",
softwareWorkImpacts,dataAnalysis,,,How the substance use impacts data analysis,"Same thing for data analysis. It's harder to really analyze data and be focused and, you know, tuned in with that when you're on marijuana it because it – at least me, I mean, it affects everybody differently, right? For me personally, it doesn't make me as focused and as productive, it just makes me think outside the box a little more.",
softwareWorkImpacts,softwareCodingAndTesting,,,How the substance use impacts software coding and testing,"And coding and testing. I mean, obviously, if an encoding requires a certain amount of working memory, and you know, maybe it's some inherent biological quality of my brain. Maybe it's just depression, but my brain really seems to be often impaired. And so taking Adderall helps with those types of tasks. So software coding and testing definitely.",
softwareWorkImpacts,design,,,How the substance use impacts software design or refactoring,"For a lot of them, I would have to say it would probably be Adderall, caffeine, or cannabis. When you're doing things like, data analysis, system design, prototyping like all those things, you want to be in a general coherent state of mind and not like super abstract.",
softwareWorkImpacts,requirements,,,How the substance use impacts requirementsElicitation,"I would say probably requirements elicitation [is a no]. Because again, that would involve other people and kind of brainstorming in a sense.",
softwareWorkImpacts,meetings,,,How substance use impacts meetings,"Oh, absolutely. When I'm in meetings or have to collaborate in any way, I'm always sober for those.",
softwareWorkImpacts,agile,,,"How substance use impacts agile or stand-up or scrum, mob-programming","I think I'm definitely a little bit more rambly at standup meetings now that I'm not on Zoloft anymore, but not so much that it negatively impacts my ability to talk about the work I'm doing and my progress. But I definitely have noticed that I tend to add probably more detail into my conversations when I'm not on the SSRI because I kind of lose focus of the point of the conversation being just a high-level overview of what I'm working on.",
other,foundFrom,,,"Where did they find this study, tag subreddit if available","r/ADHD",
other,COVID,,,When covid is mentioned,"So I come into the office [inaudible] because it's pretty safe. The protocols around vaccination and testing and stuff like that are good. You're required to take a test every single day, test negative on a rapid COVID test. In addition to that, everyone is required to be vaccinated unless you're in a conference room or eating or drinking then mask on.",
