,benzos,"Quote includes or is about benzodiazepines","Benzodiazepines make you less anxious. So in a more social setting, they would be helpful if you are group programming. If you're giving some sort of presentation about your code, I would use it in those sorts of situations because it takes away a lot of that social anxiety, a lot of that anxiety in general. And I don't know if you've ever – you've probably heard of people taking those sorts of substances for public speaking. It kinda works the same way. Big meetings, you're explaining code, you're doing that sort of thing.

But in general, it definitely does help me be able to work. So I mean, I have pretty bad anxiety and depression and it definitely gets my brain to a point where I can engage with work and where I feel less anxiety. Yeah, I think that's true of SSRIs and also Wellbutrin. And I was hoping that the stimulants would help with focus because focus has always been really difficult for me.

So I had used that at work and that would usually last a few hours and give that like opiate-type buzz.",
,psychedelics_microdosing,"Quote includes or is about psychedelics, specifically in the context of micodosing","So microdosing acid is kinda like the opposite of Adderall. So if you have like a complicated system and you kind of, or like a difficult problem, like an actually difficult problem, it's very helpful to allow you to see it from a different perspective. I don't often microdose acid because most problems that you encounter in your job are not that difficult. In terms of just pure difficulty, it's more like you just have to think about it, or reason about it.
